### What you did not do
* still did not create home user view, it would look the same to everyone as of now.
* I need to make some different files for some of my javascript, and also need to clean up the homepage still

### What problems you encountered

* The biggest issue merging front-end with back-end was communication
* Filling in a blank website is very hard, but I plan to make it something I prioritize next sprint
