### What you did not do
* Did not finish making all PATCH functions for the users, will need to go and finish that next sprint

### What problems you encountered
* Struggled for a long time to figure out how to grasp the concept of how our back-end and front-end should communicate and then implement a way in which they can through a rest API

### What you accomplished
Successfully created a connection from back-end to front-end so our servers can communicate via a rest API. Also implemented a variety of routes from /users that allow for different POST, PATCH, GET, and DELETE functions. Was able to take requests from the HTML pages and use the database functions I wrote last sprint to access the database and write, read, or change the database if given a JSON object.
