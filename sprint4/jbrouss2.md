## What you accomplished
* Information is displayed on profile html for user's specific information! - Displays name, bio, position, and email of user. I can also currenlty display the user's league and team.
* User's names are showing up on most pages! Utilized the code from profile.js to modify it for the other pages in order to display the users' username
* Spaced out the radio buttons on the create league and league admin page! There was an issue where they were super close together and I was able to make the text bigger by creating some cutom sizes for specicifc headings.
* Created a team home page - Finli will take over that page soon. For now I dropped the style guide in and added a couple headings just to show that this page is there and what it is
* Added the welcome user and logout bar to the top of the rest of the league pages and added the ability that Dean wrote that clears the cookie for whenever a user logs out on any of these other pages.
