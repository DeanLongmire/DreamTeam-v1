# Sprint 4
* Logan Bowers
* Github id: lbower10
* Dynprog

## What you planned to do
* Send team data to view teams page
* Fix get_all teams function to allow the above mentioned issue to take place

## What you did not do
* I was not yet able to accomplish sending team info to the client side just yet. Right now, there is a hard-coded array of teans,
but we would rather be able to load that data in from the database.

## What problems you encountered
* Having trouble figuring out how to read straight from the database and into a list of teams. I would like to impement this in a way that
would not require a rewrite of the existing code in the file, which handles a hard-coded list of teams.

## Issues you worked on
* (Issue #57)[https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/57]
* (Issue #61)[https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/61]

## Files you worked on
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/view_teams.js
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Back-End/controllers/global_teams.js
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Back-End/Teams/global_teams_db.js
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Back-End/Teams/teams.js

## What you accomplished
* To some degree, I think team information can be communicated to the client side. Still need to fix some quirks.
* Was able to fix syntax for a few functions, including the get_teams function for operating on the database.
