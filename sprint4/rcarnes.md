## What you planned to do
- This sprint I planned to create the functionality for retrieving league information from the database and displaying it on the create league, view leagues, and league home.
## What you did not do
- I did not fully get the league information showing on the view leagues page, but I plan on getting this done for sprint 5.
## What problems you encountered
- Juliana and I are currently working on getting all the leagues from the database to display in a list on the "view leagues" page, we need to retreive stuff from the database and store it in an array and display it, which should dynamically update when new leagues are created by other users.
## Issues you worked on
- [Issue 62](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/62)  
## Files you worked on
- DynProg/DreamTeam/Front-End/leagues/create_league.js
- DynProg/DreamTeam/Front-End/leagues/join_league.js
- DynProg/DreamTeam/Front-End/leagues/league_home.js
## What you accomplished
- The league pages now show the correct username in the top right corner, and functionality can easily be added to dynamically display other elements onto the page.
