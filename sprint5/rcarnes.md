## What you planned to do
- This sprint I planned to get the "view leagues" page to display all of the leagues in the database, and get the profile pictures for the leagues working.
## What you did not do
- I did not fully get the profile pictures showing for the leagues, but Dean was able to get it working.
## What problems you encountered
- I accidentally spelled "Leagues" as "Leages" and it messed up one of my SQL statements.
## Issues you worked on
- [Issue 64](https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/64)
