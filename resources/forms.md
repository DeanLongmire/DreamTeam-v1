## Leagues > Teams > Players

Ideally we will create the Teams from the "League" page, so that we can automatically know information about the team like it's parent league and sport

Likewise, we will create the Players from the "Team" page, so that we automatically know the parent team and sport. Not sure if we will be able to automatically get the username (it depends on if the players are added by the users/players themselves, or by the admin of the team (in which case they will need to input the username))
