### What you planned to do

### What you did not do

* If click login without filling out info, it still goes on to profile page

### What problems you encountered
* Allowing edit access on profile page - still working this out as I am trying to figure out the best method to do this
* Aligning the columns on a page to be what I wanted them to be

### Files you worked on
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/Dynprog.css
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/login.html
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/profile.html
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/profile.js
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/login.js
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/index.html (Sort of had started this as another page but it got swtiched to home page so Finli took over for it)

### What you accomplished
* Worked on profile page - Mostly set-up: there is a blank profile photo, header bar, added footer, set-up where user edit information will go
* Created login page - Set up to accept email and password, there is a message that displays where it says to fill all the fields (will need to fix this), added header and footer
* Worked on style guide - Set up official UT colors, certain margins for colunmns for profile page, pulled from existing guide and recofigured some of the settings - also renamed it to Dynprog while giving credit to the original creators
* Navigate between pages (Home -> Login -> Profile -> Home) - Can navigate to login from home and once on login can navigate to profile page. If user clicks welcome user it takes them to profile page again and log out displays message and takes user back to home page
