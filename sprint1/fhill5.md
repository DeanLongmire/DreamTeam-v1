# Sprint 1

### What you planned to do
* Create registration page - Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/7)

* Create home page - Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/5)

### What you did not do
* Did not create home user view, it would look the same to everyone as of now.
* If click create account without filling out info, it still goes on to profile page

### What problems you encountered
* I still need to make a footer and some more additions to the home page
* Using a style guide is hard when I don't know what everything is
* I really am struggling to make things look exaclty how they are in my head, takes practice I guess.

### Issues you worked on
* Create registration page - Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/7)
* Navigate from home page to other pages - Issue (https://github.com/utk-cs340-spring23/DynProg/issues/6)

### Files you worked on
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/Dynprog.css
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/Registry.html
* utk-cs340-spring23/Dynprog/DreamTeam/Front-End/index.html

### What you accomplished
* Developed a home page for the website consisting of: a picture slideshow, a scrolling navbar, navigation buttons to login and registry
* Developed a registry page that takes new user data, and made some code to flag if they did not fill out all fields
* Added some of the CSS I used to the Dynprog.css style guide so it would look better and be reusable
