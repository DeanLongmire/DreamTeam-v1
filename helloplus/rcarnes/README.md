# Hello World Plus
## install node.js then in my directory do 
## npm install prompt-sync
## may have to do npm install 
1. Run the program by doing node HelloPlus.js in terminal (will need node.js installed)
2. Enter a valid port number when prompted
3. Go to locolhost:portnumber in your browser
4. An example website being hosted on a local port will be shown with prelimenary design and ui/ux decisions
5. ctrl-c in terminal to close host

This is just a preliminary program that shows that I have my node.js + javascript + html development environment set up properly, as well as a way to test it locally. For our official project we will likely use many more modules (namely express) but i wanted to keep it light and simple for grading and to minimize bloat for this assignment.
