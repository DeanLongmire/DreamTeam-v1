# Hello World Plus Assignment
## Brief Explanation of what program does
A webpage is created that has an image at the top, header bar with a dropdown menu for one of the categories, words that fly in from two corrections, and two sets of cards that explain the project. I used the w3.css library in order to implement these features with html code. If you hover over sports, a dropdown menu appears. I consulted the various tutorials on this [website](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp), but I altered the specific information to fit my wants. Additionally I consulted a HTML [site](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) that explains how to use HTML as I have little prior experience.

# How to run 
In whatever editor you choose (I opted to use VS Code), simply open the personalprofile.html file in whatever browser that you choose. Select reveal in file explorer and open it like you would a file. This should then display the html file.
