# My Hello Plus
Logan Bowers - COSC 340

# Login System
For my helloplus assignment, I followed along with a tutorial from

Web Dev Simplified on youtube: [Node.js Passport Login System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RCnNyD0L-s).

In this tutorial, I created a login system that allows a user to register an account, login with that account, and then log out. The account is not yet saved to an actual database, rather it is stored locally in memory just for simplicity.

I gained practice with writing code to create a webpage, redirect users to different pages, and overall practice with the structure of node.js and html. On top of this, I learned how to use nodemon to host my node.js server.

As the group project progresses, some experience with CSS could allow me to style my websites how I want them as well.

# How to Run: 
* In VSCode terminal, type the command "npm run devStart" to host the server. The website URL is [localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login).
